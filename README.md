pagerduty_downtime
==================

(This is a work in progress) 

Command-line tool for creating maintenance windows in PagerDuty app. 

Requires JSON package: 
    sudo cpan JSON

Configure the values in the "Configurable parameters" block for your subdomain,
token and requestor id. These are marked with the placeholder value "CHANGEME!!!"

Once complete, you can step through interactively or trigger via one-liner (requires knowledge of PD service id strings).
